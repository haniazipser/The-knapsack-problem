# The knapsack problem
## Project Overview
-This project involves implementing a solution to the classic **Knapsack Problem**.
-The objective is to select a subset of items to include in a knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed the given capacity and the total value is maximized.
-Two solutions are provided, one recursive, one iterative.

## Provided Solutions
This repository includes **two separate implementations** of the algorithm:
1. **Recursive solution** – a direct approach using pure recursion to explore possible item combinations.
2. **Iterative simulation of recursion** – an alternative version that **simulates recursion using an explicit stack**. This stack manually stores *data frames* representing recursive calls, effectively mimicking the behavior of the call stack.
